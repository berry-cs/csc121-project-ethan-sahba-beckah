TODO:

FlappyApp.java:
1. Initialize the setup of the window including the window size and drawing FlappyWorld. (DONE)

Ball.java:
1. Create ball class and draw ball. (DONE)
2. Apply gravity and collision to ball. (Almost Done)
      - Paddle collision/bounce still needs to be implemented
      - Add a method that detects when the ball is touching a wall and
      	if the ball is touching a wall to end the game
      	
Paddle.java:
1. Create paddle class and draw the paddle successfully (DONE)
      - Make sure paddle is following mouse as well as is centered with the mouse (DONE)
2. Implement bounce so that when the ball touches the paddle (no matter how much momentum it has) it always bounces off (NOT DONE)

Wall.java:
1. Create wall class and render walls (DONE/WIP)
      - Fix spacing on the walls so that the gap between the top and bottom wall is not so large
      - Potentially alter code so that it never stops rendering walls till the game is over
        (currently the code is set to render 100 walls only)
      - Make it so that as the game goes on the gaps get harder and harder to clear either by changing the gap size
        or just speeding up the walls.







sidenote:
  - Move list code from FlappyApp.java that initializes a list of walls as well as the code the code that renders the walls
    to the Wall.java file
