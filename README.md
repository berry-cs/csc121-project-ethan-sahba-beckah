This is a Flappy Bird clone made using Java and the Processing library.

Run the main method in the FlappyApp class to play the game.

## Features
* **⌨️ Keyboard input**: Utilizes keyboard input to detect when the user presses the space bar to either propel the bird upwards or to return a new game state.
* **📂 Highscore Management**: This program uses File I/O to manage highscores in the game.
* **📏 Dynamic Difficulty**: The speed of the walls increases as the player progresses through the game, in turn, increasing the difficulty.
* **🔊 Sound Effects**: Incorporates sound effects for key game events, such as the flap of the bird's wings, collisions, and scoring points.
* **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**: The code is well-documented, making it easy for others to understand and contribute to the project.

## Controls
* **Space Bar**: The space bar is the only thing you'll need. It starts the game, restarts the game upon game over, and propels the bird upwards.
